# Air Quality Data Analysis

## Data contains 
1. details about different air quality measurement stations in India.
2. details about different pollutant concentrations as of Sept. 2018.
3. maximum, minimum and average values of the pollutants measured during the day. 

Data obtained from data.gov.in

## Data is analysed for 
1. the calculation of the Air Quality Index (AQI).
2. creating dataframes state-wise instead of station-wise.
3. comparing pollutant concentrations, ranking different states based of AQI. 

## Graphs generated
The state names of the x-axis are in ascending order of the AQI. The values not mapped on the graphs were found lacking in the dataset itself, presumably due to the lack of measurement facilities at the concerned stations.

1. AQI values of all states
